The summary of the content of week 2.

Firstly, QA in Context. In different processes, what QA focuses are diffrent. In process requirments and 
specification, design and coding, QA focuses on defect prevention. In coding and testing, QA focus on 
defect removal. In the release and support process, it focuses on defect containment. QA scattered throughout all 
processes. V&V in V-model make it clear that how to verify the quality by different test methods in 
different processes. We can say that QA is in the overall development context.

The second is that SQE contains three activities : quality planning, QA activities and QA analysis/feedback 
which all are part of development activities. Quality planning is part of product planning. QA activities 
are part of development activities. And analysis/feedback is part of project management.

The third part is about testing. Testing contains plannning and preparation, execution and analysis & Follow-up.  
We can't stop testing before all the quality-based criteria are reached unless we hava cretical resource limit.

That's my summary of week 2.

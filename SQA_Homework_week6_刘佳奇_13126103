The followings are pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives.

1 testing vs. defect prevention

1) Applicability: testing is about code but defect prevention is about known causes.
2) Effectiveness: testing deals with occasional failures but defect prevention deals with systematic problems.
3) Cost: the cost of test is medium but that of defect prevention is low(lower than testing).

2 testing vs. inspection

1) Applicability: testing is about code but inspection is about s/w artifacts.
2) Effectiveness: testing deals with occasional failures but inspection deals with scattered faults.
3) Cost: the cost of test is medium but that of inspection is low-medium(lower than testing).

3 testing vs. formal verification

1) Applicability: testing is about code but formal verification is about formal specification.
2) Effectiveness:testing deals with occasional failures but formal verification deals with fault absence.
3) Cost: the cost of test is medium but that of formal verification is high(higher than testing).

4 testing vs. fault tolerance

1) Applicability: testing is about code but fault tolerance is about duplication.
2) Effectiveness: testing deals with occasional failures but fault tolerance deals with rare-cond. failures.
3) Cost: the cost of test is medium but that of fault tolerance is high(higher than testing).

5 testing vs. failure containment

1) Applicability: testing is about code but failure containment is about known hazards.
2) Effectiveness: testing deals with occasional failures but failure containment deals with rare-cond. accidents.
3) Cost: the cost of test is medium but that of failure containment is highest(higher than all).

The following is my understanding of formal methods in general and model checking in particular.

We knows formal methods = formal specification + formal verification. What is formal specification and formal 

verification?Formal specification (FS) is part of defect prevention to prevent/reduce defect injection due to 

imprecision, ambiguity, etc. Formal verification is part of QA, but focus on positive "Prove absence of fault". 

FS is briefly covered as related to FV.

Firstly formal inspection, inspection is Part of QA. It is throughout the software process: in coding phase 

code inspection is used and in design phase design inspection is used, etc. Its generic process is: Planning

and preparation (individual), Collection (group/meeting) and Repair (followup). Based on that generic process, 

there are some variations of it. Fagan inspection and other expanded Fagan inspections are mentioned which 

include six steps: Planning Overview (1-to-n meeting), Preparation (individual inspection), Inspection (n-to-n 

meeting), Rework, Follow-up. Sencondly formal verification, basic approaches include Floyd/Hoare axiomatic, 

Dijkstra/Gries weakest precond (WP), Mills’ prog calculus/functional approach, etc. The model checking is 

behavioral specification via FSMs, properties of interest expressed as a suitable formula. Some algorithm/program 

are used to check proposition validity.
